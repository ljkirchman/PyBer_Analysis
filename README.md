Below are key facts that have come to light in reviewing the Summary Report.

1.  While Urban cities dominate the number of rides (68.4%), they have too many drivers, 81% of all drivers.  Hence each driver earns less money.

2.  Both Suburban and Rural drivers earn more money than the average fare per ride, which suggests that the company might want to increase the number of drivers in these areas.

While I was unsuccessful in creating my own line chart, I did review the data included in Part 2 Instructions.

The following conclusions can be made:

1. The Total Fares earned in the Rural Market appears to be declining slightly.  Since the fare per ride is fairly high, I'd look into the average price to see if there is a correlation between price and the number of rides.

2.  It appears the Total Fares Earned in the Urban Market is trending upwards, although the largest growth in revenue appears to have come from the Suburban market.
